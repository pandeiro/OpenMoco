# OpenMoko Product Guidelines

## Prose Style

**Technical and Concise:** All UI text, documentation, and communications use minimal words with maximum clarity. Target audience is developers who value efficiency.

Guidelines:
- Use short, direct sentences
- Avoid marketing fluff and unnecessary adjectives
- Prefer specific technical terms over vague descriptions
- Lead with the most important information
- Use consistent terminology throughout

## Brand Messaging

**Core Theme: Empowering - "Code anywhere, anytime"**

OpenMoko empowers developers to break free from the desk. The messaging emphasizes freedom, flexibility, and capability.

Brand Voice:
- Confident without being arrogant
- Enabling rather than prescriptive
- Action-oriented language
- Celebrates developer autonomy

Key Messages:
- Your development environment, in your pocket
- Voice your ideas, ship your code
- From thought to production, anywhere

## Visual Identity

### Dark Mode First
- Default theme optimized for developer comfort and OLED efficiency
- High contrast text on dark backgrounds
- Accent colors used sparingly for emphasis
- Consistent with popular developer tools

### Minimal Chrome
- Reduce UI chrome to maximize content area
- Hide navigation until needed
- Use whitespace intentionally
- Avoid decorative elements that don't serve function

### Touch-Optimized
- Minimum 44px tap targets for all interactive elements
- Generous spacing between clickable items
- Swipe gestures for common actions
- Bottom-aligned controls for thumb reachability

## Feedback and Status Communication

**Hybrid Approach: Visual Primary, Audio for Critical Events**

### Visual Feedback (Primary)
- Real-time progress indicators for ongoing operations
- Status badges for repository and build states
- Inline confirmations for completed actions
- Subtle animations for state transitions

### Audio Feedback (Critical Events Only)
- Push notification sounds for CI/CD failures
- Audio cues for voice recording start/stop
- Optional audio confirmations for critical actions

## Accessibility (Post-MVP)

Accessibility features are deferred to post-MVP releases. Focus remains on core functionality and user experience for the target developer audience.
